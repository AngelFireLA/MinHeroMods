All the mods for Min Hero: Tower of Sages are to be compiled here

Stay tuned!


## TODO:
Core (things that are present across all versions)
* Fix the spelling mistakes in the code. It's so easy to do, we might as well
* Add mod managing system (square_nine)

Multi (things just for the multiplayer as that's going to enter here RAAH)
* Check BattleSystem for socket entry point
* How to make a TrainerDataObject work with OwnedMinion list? (might be a new class)
